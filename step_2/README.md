# step_2

Getting started with dart. Code a little bit.
- Apply techniches from other programming languages you know using dart
- Google a little bit the features

# Data, Functions and manipulation
In this step, we'll show off some basic Dart tricks to help you get into the language faster. Many more to discover but here you can find:

- **Optional parameters**: To declare an optional parameter, enclose it in brackets.
- **Nullable types**: To indicate that a type can be nullable, append ? after the type declaration. However, be careful, as it's sometimes better to avoid using this feature and instead handle null cases to prevent future errors.
- **Arrow functions**: These are unnamed functions that declare like this `() => {}`. They are a clean and easy-to-use way of defining simple functions.
- **Functions as parameters**: Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions, which can be helpful in certain programming scenarios.
- **`for` loops inside array declarations**: This is a fast and easy way to manipulate and initialize data at initialization.
