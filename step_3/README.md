2. Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code.
3. Install the dependencies by running `flutter pub get` in the terminal.
4. Run the app with `flutter run` command in the terminal or use the Run button in the IDE.

## Project Structure
- `main.dart` file contains the code for the `MyApp` widget which is the root of the app.
- `MyHomePage` widget is the home page of the app and it contains the code for the counter and the button that increments it.
- `pubspec.yaml` file lists the dependencies used in the project.

## How to Use

## Notes
